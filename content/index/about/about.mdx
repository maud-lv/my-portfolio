My name is Maud Levy, I'm a Community Advocacy Program Manager at Microsoft. I help developers, IT professionals and students learn how to use our services, use popular languages and framework.

I don't do this on my own! I build community initiatives and work with very talented engineers at Microsoft who create wonderful content for the community.

This is me.
